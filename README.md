- Secure and Highly Performance
### Regions vs Availability Zones
- Regions are multiple isolated locations within each Region (Paris could contain 5 Nodes spread out in the City)
- Regions consist of multiple Availability Zone
- Allows multiple instances where each Instance can be in different Zones to allow for High Uptime
### What are the four Pillars of Cloud Computing
- Ease of use
- Flexibility
- Robustness
- Cost effective
### What is CDN
- Content Delivery Network
- Deploying it to a Server in England
- The Service will also deploy a copy to another Server in a different region to ensure that it has Global Access
### On PREM VS Hybrid - On PREM VS Public Cloud
- Private Cloud
  - Cloud Computing that is solely dedicated to your organizatin
  - Dedicated and Secure
  - Efficient
- Public Cloud
  - Cloud Computing that is shared across Organizations
  - No Maintanence Costs
  - Agile for Innovation
- Hybrid
  - Any environment that uses Both Public and Private
  - Policy Driven
  - Workload Diversity therefore High Reliability
